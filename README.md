# S.A.S-Travel

Create an API for our travel journal, where the admin can add, update, view, and delete journal entries and/or users. As a user you will be able to auto your account and log in. Once logged in you are able to complete CRUD only your entries. User can have view access to the default entries setup by the admin.
